The Visual Studio and C# Programming Language
==============================================================================================================

What is Visual Studio? (VS, current version is 2015)
----------------------------------------------------
Visual Studio is an IDE - Integrated Develpment Environment.

It integrates CLS compliant languages, CTS, and CLR. It also provide number of tools through which we can easily develop and rapidly develop the applications.

Visual Studio assists us in many ways:

 1. Allow us to write code - copy+paste+ format+create files/folders + add remove resources - 
 2. Compile the one or more code files using "build tool" - A tool that produce MSIL code (assemblies) using C# or
	any CLS compliant language.
 3. Debug the applications
 4. Design the database
 5. Source code control - Source control protocols - Git, Microsoft Team Foundation, Mercury, SVN
 6. HTML, XML designer and many more useful tools.

The Project system and visual studio
=====================================
A "project" is an application structure which describes,
 1. The nature of application or application type - web, window, phone, console or service application
 2. It includes reference of neccessary CTS libraries or assemblies e.g mscorlib.dll, System.Data.Dll etc
    Different applications uses different set of CTS dlls.
 3. It includes a reference or path to the language (C# or VB etc) and it uses "build-tool" to compile your
	code easily and produce .exe or .dll assemblies
 4. It offers two types builds - Debug and Release.

     Debug means an application run by the developers to examine or test the behavior and test whether it is developed
     as per their or customer's requirement or not. Debug applications contains .net framework debug & diagnostic   
     libraries that assists us (developers) to understand what is happing inside the code when that application
	is being executed/run.

	Debug applications allow us to set break points, step-in/out execution of code and learn how much memory being
	used, how many processes are there and many more things.

        Release build means a final build for the deployment (ready to be used by customers/clients). This will removes
        debug & diagnostic assistance from the code and the "Release" version of code will be smaller in size.
