For example,
   markup means a way to separate one thing from another.
   We generally uses , or blank or special character to separate the items. In English language we use . (period) to separate the sentences and comma (,) to split the sentence.

 Example: 10,rajesh,1,A are the data of student and we mentally uses labels - roll, name, standard and division.
    In case, if we add markup (Just like HTML tags)

<student>
  <roll>10</roll>
  <name>A</name>
  <standard>1</standard>
  <division>A</division>
</student>

Example:

<important category="definition" subject="web">
   HTML - HTML is a standard to present data on the web. It is markup language not a programming language.
</important>

HTML standard is maintained (proposed and draft and maintainace) by the non profit organizations - World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and HTML working group. (Visit www.w3c.org)
